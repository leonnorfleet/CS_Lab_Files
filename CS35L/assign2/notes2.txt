Exercise 2.1:

1. # bits expression:

(defun sqr (a)
  (* a a))
sqr

(defvar x (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1)))

a b c d

(defun num-bits(n)
  (setq a 1)
  (setq c n)

  (while (< 1 c)
    (setq c (/ c 2))
    (setq a (+ a 1)))
  (print a))

2. C-h k C-h k opens the help menu for the C-h k command itself, which is the command describe key. It can be invoked from the general help menu(C-h b) so they are related

3. C-h k M-SPC opens the help menu for the M-SPC command which is cycle-spacing

4. Using M-SPC cycles the number of spaces between text from 0 spaces, 1 space, and the original amount of spaces it had between the two

5. the general function is cycle-spacing

Homework:

1. An index error is raised because /dev/null is an empty file. The error originates in the python ver. 2.7 random.py file. It tries to return a value in a sequence(in this case, a line in a file) but the sequence is empty because the file is empty.

2. optparse was depreciated so it doesn't work in python3. Any argument using the library won't work.

3. /usr/bin/python3 test:
   	real 0m0.912s
	user 0m0.845
	sys 0m0.052

   /usr/local/cs/bin/python3 test:
        real 0m0.641
	user 0m0.586
	sys 0m0.037
